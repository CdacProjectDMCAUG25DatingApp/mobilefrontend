### useIsFocused()
In React Native navigation, the hook for checking if a screen is focused is called useIsFocused. It returns a boolean value (true if the screen is focused, false otherwise). 
Usage
The useIsFocused hook is used for conditionally rendering elements based on the screen's focus state, such as displaying different content or status bar configurations.
